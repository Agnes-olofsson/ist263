            <h2>Attachable Gloves</h2>
            <p>Gloves that keep you warm and dry are essential for anyone being outside for an extended period of time, especially when it involves snow. However, I have found that my favorite addition to my skiing kit are my gloves that attach to my hands. I take off my gloves countless times everytime I ski, and it is so convenient to be able to remove them without having to worry about losing one. Additionally, I always bring liners to wear inside of my gloves if it gets really cold. Layering always provides more isolation, so this will help your hands to stay warm.</p>

            <h2>Ski Strapps</h2>
            <p>I hiked up my first mountain when I was nine years old, but it was not until 2018 that I discovered the best and easiest way to carry your skis when you are walking up a mountain. Ski straps are small enough to keep in a pocket, yet they have become an essential for everyone in my family. They come in many variations and various brands have tried to develop their own spin of them. However, most additions are useless. All you need is a band that is connected like a circle. All you need to do is loop your skis though the band and all of a sudden you have created a backpack. There are many tutorials online on exactly how to do this. This will allow you to hike up the mountain with a bit of extra weight on your back instead of having to change your entire movement pattern because your skis are on your shoulder. </p>

            <h2>Shell Jacket</h2>
            <p>Having a jacket that is only a shell might seem counterintuitive at first. However, it has been one of the most beneficial changes that I have made. Because of the nature of the sport, it is important to wear things that will keep you warm, but laying different types of material is a way more effective way to do so compared to having one thick jacket. When it is really cold I wear two jackets, which might seem a little tedious but by using one down jacket and one waterproof shell jacket I have created more isolation. On the other hand, on a warm day or when I am walking up a mountain it is nice to be able to scale down and wear less. In other words, it is more flexible and more functional. </p>

            <h2>All Around Skis</h2>
            <p>There are many skis on the market, but I have found that the most neutral skis work the best. Ofcourse, if you are an expert skier with special needs and interests, you should get skis that are intended for that purpose. However, with a good pair of skis with sharp edges you can get away with one pair for almost all snow conditions. Therefore, I advise against getting skis that are hourglass shaped and only intended for slopes that have been groomed as well as getting skis that are wide and have twin tips that are great for backcountry and lots of snow. It is easy to get carried away while entering the market for skis, but even though it might seem like a good idea at the moment to get the best niche product that is promising you the best experience, it is usually not worth it. With a good pair of all-around skis, the majority of skiers will have a fantastic skiing experience.</p>
