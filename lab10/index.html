            Outside of work I like going horseback riding as well as skiing. I have always loved the outdoors and try to spend as much time outside as I can when the weather allows.
            My favorite TV shows of all time are Peaky Blinders and Rick and Morty, but I am not the biggest fan of TV shows.
